            <CENTER>Hi, I'm Ashley. I'm 22 years old and let me tell you a little about myself.</CENTER> <BR>
              
I am currently attending a University majoring for a degree in Information Systems. I consider myself an introverted person than an extroverted and I would like to improve on that. I occasionally try to improve myself by practicing yoga a few times a week. I enjoy drinking coffee and spending time with my cats. My favorite hoppy is practicing my photography skills. I’m still an amateur photographer but I have always had an interest in photography since high school. I got my first camera when I was 14 years old, I would take my camera to school and take photos of my friends and upload them to Facebook. The reason I never persuaded photography as a career was because I just didn’t want it to become something stressful and having to rely on it as my income. I also never want a reason to start to dislike photography, this comes from having to do something because you have to verses just doing it for fun. My favorite thing to take photos of are people. A photographer that I admire are Jessica Kobeissi who is also Youtuber, her channel has to do with photography as well. Cole Sprouse is another photographer that I admire, He does photography professionally as well as being an actor in popular shows. My goal is to keep working on my photography and documenting my process in this blog/ personal diary. This blog is meant for me to become more active in expressing myself.
