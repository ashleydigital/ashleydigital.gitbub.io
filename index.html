            <CENTER>Hi, I'm Ashley. I'm 22 years old and let me tell you a little about myself.</CENTER> <BR>
              I decided to start my own website because just
            making one seems fun to make. I would’ve made one sooner, but I just never had time to make one, and this
            time I have to make one for a class I am currently taking. That says a lot about me already, I tend to
            sometimes procrastinate but who doesn’t right? It’s a habit to always try to be the best person you can but
            sometimes people mess up and I think that’s okay (to some extent). I’m currently attending the University
            and perusing a degree in Information Systems. One of my favorite hobbies is practicing my photography
            skills. I’m still an armature photographer but I’ve always had an interest of it since high school. When I
            was attending high school, I would take my camera to school and take photos of my friends and upload them on
            Facebook. The reason I never persuaded photography as a career was because I just didn’t want it to become
            something stressful, as well something I would eventually dislike. This comes from a stigma that a job is a
            job, you could enjoy it, but it’ll eventually become stressful. I’m getting back into photography, it has
            been difficult journey because of the burn out I have been feeling with going to school and working. This
            year is going to change. My favorite things to photograph are people, especially my friends. This is what my
            blog it’s a little piece of the internet where I am able to express myself and my thoughts.
