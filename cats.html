            <CENTER>Charlie</CENTER> <BR>
            From all my cats, I’ve had Charlie the longest. He’s been with me for almost 7 years. So, 7 years ago my mom
            was picking me up from high school. When she picked me up, she asked me where I wanted to go eat, Olive
            Garden or Pizza Hut. I chose Pizza Hut for some weird reason, because Olive Garden was my favorite
            restaurant at the time, and I still don’t know why I decided to go to Pizza Hut. I’m assuming because it was
            closer from our current location. Anyways, we go to Pizza Hut and its right next to a Churches’ Chicken.
            When we got out of the car, we heard a loud cat cry. There was a cat somewhere meowing very loudly. At this
            time we both thought the cat was in trouble and it sounded very close by, so we look around for the cat. I’m
            following the loud cry and I start walking towards Churches and these flower bushes. When I crouch down to
            look what was inside the bushes a cute kitten ran towards me. It seemed like someone dumped him there since
            there were no houses close by. I decided to take him home with me. Charlie has been through a lot with me.
            Through some of my high school years, when I decided to move out at 18 years old, and till now. It’s been through an
            emotional ride. Charlie always seems to come to me when I’m feeling sad, he loves to sleep with me also.
            He’s such a teddy bear full of love, I can’t get over him. He could be supper sassy sometimes and likes to
            pick fights with his sisters, but still he is very loved.

            <CENTER>Cupcake</CENTER> <BR>
            I got cupcake a few years after Charlie, when I moved out to my first apartment. At this point I was working
            and going to school and I wanted Charlie to have a friend to hang out with when I wasn’t home. I ended up
            getting Cupcake through a girl on Facebook, that was giving a cat away. I contacted her and met up and she
            gave me Cupcake. She was so sweet and tiny at the time. Charlie was pretty upset and was very jealous when I
            got another cat. He refused to sleep with me for months and that’s because he loves sleeping with me. It took
            him a while to adjust and now they all love each other. Cupcake is so unique, she talks a lot compared to
            the other cats, she likes to play fetch and do tricks. She loves her toys that we buy her. She loves food,
            we have to cut her off because she just loves to eat, and she’s getting chunky. I’m glad I have her as a
            cat.

              <CENTER>Pepper</CENTER> <BR>

              Pepper is the youngest cat she’s younger than Cupcake but she’s larger in size. I got Pepper like 2 years
              ago at this point I moved out to another apartment with my roommates. We moved to a bigger place and that
              justified me getting another cat. One of my coworkers’ cats got pregnant and she was giving away the
              kittens. The mom was a Persian cat and the dad was an alley cat. She was the cutest kitten ever, she was a
              black fluffy fur ball. She was supper shy at the beginning but now that she’s older she is fearless. She
              demands for pets, she meows to let us know what she wants. She’s obsessed with boxes, the other cats like
              boxes to but she loves them compared to them. She’s so unique and special in her own way.
